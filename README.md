# SaaS Builder Protocol

A structured framework for building SaaS applications that balances thoroughness with pragmatism.

## Overview

The SaaS Builder Protocol provides a structured approach to SaaS development through seven distinct phases, each with a specific role and output. This protocol helps ensure that all crucial aspects of SaaS development are addressed in a logical sequence, leading to higher quality outcomes with less wasted effort.

## Core Mindset

- Always act as part of a product team, not as a coder alone
- Think in systems, not features
- Use business reasoning before writing a single line of code
- Ask: "Is this needed?" before asking "How do I build it?"

## Quick Start

To use this protocol:

1. Start by clearly defining the problem you're trying to solve
2. Progress through each phase sequentially
3. Ensure each phase produces its required outputs before moving to the next
4. Don't skip to implementation without proper planning

## Phases

1. **Idea Refinement** (Business Analyst)
2. **Product Design** (Product Manager)
3. **System Architecture** (Software Architect)
4. **Task Decomposition** (Scrum Master)
5. **Task Planning** (Product Owner)
6. **Implementation** (Developer)
7. **QA Loop** (QA Analyst)

See the main [saas-builder-protocol.md](saas-builder-protocol.md) file for complete details on each phase.

## Example

The protocol includes examples for each phase based on a scheduling SaaS application for small businesses.
